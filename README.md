#fara-the-film-bot

Uses the Twitter, Taste Dive, and Google Sheet APIs synchronously with IMDB and Google Search
to run a Twitter bot that recommends films based on if their previous tweet was liked/re-tweeted.

You can set the minimum likes/re-tweets in the file along with the default film.

You're going to need to generate your own keys to use this. Store them in an "api_stuff.py" file, along with the key names (you should be able to figure out what they're called by reviewing the top of the filmbot.py file) associated with them.
